A mobile application developed using the python module kivy to retrieve various stats on the covid-19 pandemic.   
Used the python Modules Kivy and Kivy Md to make the UI.   
Retrieved active stats on the virus from an API to display in app.   
Used pickle to implement a file handling system and store user preferred app theme information. 
Finally, used buildozer on Linux to compile into an APK (app will crash if correct requirements are not mentioned in the .spec file)   
Note: make sure the .py and .kv file are in the same folder when running.
